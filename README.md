# sinch-callkit
a sinch video project for IOS that needs Callkit integrated

We like to implement callkit in this demo app that sinch provides.
Ik you open the sinch>samples folder you find the xcodeproject file.
Callkit is supposed to replace the push notifications currently implemented in the project so feel free to comment or remove that functionality.
To test the project you can download the javascript demo, run it on your mac and call the IOS client from it.
To make sure both applications can find eachother you'll have to set the applicationKey in the javascript project to the key in the email.
the goal is to make the iphone ring using callkit when it receives a call from the sinch js app.
